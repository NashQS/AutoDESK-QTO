# Project Overview
This project demonstrates how I used Autodesk Takeoff to accurately measure, take off, and quantify the components of a residential house. Below is a summary of the process:
# Tools
The project was produced using AutoDESk Construction CLOUD.

The data from AutoDESK was exported to Excel

# Project Steps
## 1.Developing a Custom Excel Template

    I designed a coded Excel template to streamline data organization for takeoff elements.
    The template included pre-defined classifications such as walls, floors, roofs, doors, and windows, each with unique codes to align with project specifications.
    These classifications ensured consistency and ease of mapping between the Excel file and Autodesk Takeoff.

## 2.Importing the Excel Template to Autodesk Takeoff

    The coded Excel template was imported into Autodesk Takeoff to establish a standardized classification system.
    By doing this, I mapped the takeoff elements to predefined categories, which automated the organization of measured data during the takeoff process.

## 3.Setup and Importing Plans

    Architectural drawings (PDFs and CAD files) were imported into Autodesk Takeoff.
    I used the imported classifications to link elements from the plans with the coded template, ensuring seamless categorization of measurements.

## 4.Measuring Quantities

    Using Autodesk Takeoff tools, I accurately measured areas, lengths, and volumes for all elements.
    The predefined classifications from the Excel template made it easier to organize the measurements into their respective categories.

## 5.Generating and Exporting Data

    I compiled all measured quantities into a structured output within Autodesk Takeoff.
    The data was exported into a detailed Excel report, ready for integration with estimation tools or further analysis.
